# button
JavaScript Button

Here I created a Javascript button.

This is a little button in the script tag of a html page. 

-The client requirements were to have the search results open in a new window with specific URL details.
-User should be able to hit enter key or submit button.
-User should be able to fill in 1, 2, or none search criteria.

Note: This will not open a new window in Safari due to Safari criteria. However the current page will display the results.

All Client specific details removed before github.
